# Cricket_Statistics_DataPipeline_GCloud_Airflow
This project demonstrates the implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Google Cloud DataFusion and Apache Airflow. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience with these powerful data engineering tools. The pipeline extracts data from various sources, performs transformations, and loads it into a data warehouse for analysis and visualization.

# Features
Data Extraction: Pull data from multiple sources such as APIs, databases, and cloud storage.

Data Transformation: Clean, filter, and aggregate data using DataFusionâ€™s transformation capabilities.

Data Loading: Load the transformed data into Google BigQuery for further analysis and visualization.

Orchestration and Scheduling: Use Apache Airflow to schedule, monitor, and manage the end-to-end data pipeline.

Scalability and Flexibility: Leverage the scalability of Google Cloud Platform for efficient data processing and storage.

# Technologies Used
Google Cloud DataFusion: A fully managed, cloud-native data integration service for quickly building and managing data pipelines.

Apache Airflow: An open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

Google BigQuery: A serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse designed for business agility.
